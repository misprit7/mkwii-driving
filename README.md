# Mario Kart Wii Driving Bot

This is a project to implement a self driving AI in Mario Kart Wii. Right now it can kind of drive around SNES Mario Circuit 3, although it will occasionally go off track. If I have some more time I might see if I can improve this to more tracks with a more robust driving algorithm.
